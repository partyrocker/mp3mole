mp3Mole
=======

A PHP script that acts as a mediator for any direct download that is blocked by a firewall. 

How It Works
------------
### Memory Mode
In this mode, the file is read from the server and pushed to the user in real-time. The mediating server's file system will never be written to.

### File Mode
In this mode, the file is read in its entity and then written to the mediating server's file system. The user simply has to download the new file directly from the mediating server.


How To Use
----------
1. Sign up for a hosting account if you don't already have one.
2. Upload mp3Mole to a convenient location on that server.
3. Access that location.
